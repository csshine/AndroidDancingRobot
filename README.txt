/**********************************************************************
* What is your name?
***********************************************************************/

<Kramer Canfield>



/**********************************************************************
* Describe any inspiration for your robot and its dance!
***********************************************************************/

<I used custom colors and my robot dances the "robot" dance with rotating arms.>



/**********************************************************************
* Is there anything I need to know about building and running your app?
***********************************************************************/

<No, it uses the given standards.>



/**********************************************************************
* Did you add any extensions to the assignment that I should be aware 
* of?
***********************************************************************/

<No extensions.>



/**********************************************************************
* Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete assignment?
***********************************************************************/

<24>


/**********************************************************************
 * Describe any serious problems you encountered in this assignment.
 * What was hard, or what should we warn students about in the future?
 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/

<The six-step drawing algorithm was difficult to understand as well as the overall structure of the program such as whether or not we needed instance variables for each part of the robot. The dancing itself was not too bad, but adding a button is very tricky.>



/**********************************************************************

 * doing the assignment, whether you enjoyed doing it, etc.

<The dancing is a little weird in that I could make the robot raise his arms/legs slowly and smoothly, but could not make the robot return to its original position smoothly, it sort of snaps. I commented out the rotation of the entire robot on approx. line 282 inside the drawTorso() method; uncomment to watch the robot spin. You'll notice that I used mTempMatrix as my working matrix, rather than the mModelMatrix, but it works exactly the same otherwise.   >
